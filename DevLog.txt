1) In foc.c->MotorInit(): zero angle initialized using attached as5600 sensor.
   Implement as5600 object attached to each motor instance (unique I2C handler address)
   Check sensor connected and store zero startup angle.

2) HAL_GetTick() returns number of ticks since last reboot/startup, with each tick being 1ms.

3) Since timer ticks are unsigned int, there is no need to handle overflow since now - prev if now has overflowed will automatically correct.

4) Timer utils requires DWT_Init() to be called in main.

5) Added open loop velocity control. Function generates and updates the motor->params->el_angle param in each iteration based on the time elapsed and desired velocity.
